# Weather-Dashboard

## usage 
As a user who wants to traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
So that I can plan a trip accordingly

## Description 
The application is meant to use the weather API from the openweathermap site. Using this url the application was meant to grab the information of the city using its coordinates. On the actual application the information was meant to display the cities' name and the weather information (the temperature, wind speed, humidity). This assignment is still a work in progress. I have not yet been able to make the api function correctly and have not been able to get the fetched information to display it on the application.
